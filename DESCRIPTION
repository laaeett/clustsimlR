Description: Provides functions for single-cell data clustering analysis, with
    the use of within-cluster covariances to  characterise a cluster and to 
    assess similarity or difference between clusters. Functions for data
    preprocessing and dimensionality reduction, for clustering (by Gaussian 
    Mixture Modelling) and for data visualisation are provided. This aims to 
    provide the user with a simple interface to conduct single-cell clustering
    analysis in a manner that takes into account the finer shape of the clusters
    and how this shape differs between them.
