Compute a Covariance-based Inter-cluster Similarity Metric

## Description

Provides functions for single-cell data clustering analysis, with
the use of within-cluster covariances to  characterise a cluster and to 
assess similarity or difference between clusters. Functions for data
preprocessing and dimensionality reduction, for clustering (by Gaussian 
Mixture Modelling) and for data visualisation are provided. This aims to 
provide the user with a simple interface to conduct single-cell clustering
analysis in a manner that takes into account the finer shape of the clusters
and how this shape differs between them.

## Installation

You can install the development version of clustsimlR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
library("devtools")
devtools::install_github("laaeett/clustsimlR", build_vignettes = TRUE)
library("clustsimlR")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(clustsimlR)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
