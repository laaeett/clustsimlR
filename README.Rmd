Compute a Covariance-based Inter-cluster Similarity Metric

## Description

Provides functions for single-cell data clustering analysis, with the use of within-cluster covariances to  characterise a cluster and to assess similarity or difference between clusters. Functions for data preprocessing and dimensionality reduction, for clustering (by Gaussian Mixture Modelling) and for data visualisation are provided. This aims to provide the user with a simple interface to conduct single-cell clustering analysis in a manner that takes into account the finer shape of the clusters and how this shape differs between them, which is a concept that is not widely explored in clustering analysis. This package aims to achieve this by offering functionalities to compute an inter-cluster distance metric designed for covariance matrices which can be inferred through clustering analyses such as GMM (Förstner & Moonen, 2003). 

### Specifications of machine used to develop `clustsimlR`

R version 4.5.1 (2025-06-13 ucrt)
<br>
Platform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64

## Installation

To install the latest version of the package:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
library("devtools")
devtools::install_github("laaeett/clustsimlR", build_vignettes = TRUE)
library("clustsimlR")
```

To run the shinyApp:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Under construction
```

## Overview:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ls("package:clustsimlR") # lists functions in clustsimlR
data(package = "clustsimlR") # lists datasets
browseVignettes("clustsimlR") # load vignettes
```

`clustsimlR` contains the following 8 functions.

1.  ***checkEverything*** for checking the data to be analysed for missing data and zero-inflation

2.  ***PCA*** for conducting PCA on the data, with functionality to plot a Scree plot and a heatmap of PC coefficients

3.  ***plot_PC*** for plotting a scatter plot of the PC scores with respect to two PCs

4. ***plot_loss*** for plotting the BIC and ICL values for different models for Gaussian Mixture Modelling, for different numbers of clusters fitted

5. ***fit_GMM*** for clustering by Gaussian Mixture Modelling

6. ***plot_GMM_clusters*** for plotting a t-SNE of the data, coloured by cluster membership

7. ***calculate_dist*** for computing the distance between two covariance matrices, using the metric described by Förstner & Moonen, (2003)

8. ***intercluster_dist*** for computing a distance matrix based on inter-distances between within-cluster covariance matrices from GMM analysis, with functionality to plot a heatmap of the distance matrix.

The package also includes one sample dataset, called "dasatinib".

## Contributions:

The author of the package is Laeticia Liawas. The author wrote the 8 functions included with the package, while making use of external packages.
`checkEverything` is a function to check for missing values and zero-inflation, and to fix them if desired by the user. This function makes use of the `Hmisc::impute` function from the `Hmisc` package for imputation of missing values.
`PCA` is a function for conducting PCA on the data, and to plot a Scree plot and a heatmap of PC coefficients if desired. The function makes use of the `stats::princomp` and the `stats::screeplot` functions from the `stats` package for conducting PCA and plotting a Scree plot. The function also makes use of the `pheatmap` package to generate a heatmap of the PC coefficients.
`plot_PC` is a function to create a scatter plot of PCA scores with respect to 2 PCs. The function makes use of the `ggplot2` package for scatter plot plotting.
`plot_loss` is a function to plot the BIC and the ICL value for plotting the BIC and ICL values for different models for Gaussian Mixture Modelling, for different numbers of clusters fitted.
`fit_GMM` is a function for running GMM analysis itself. This function and the previous function makes use of the `mclust` package for GMM fitting, and for computing BIC and ICL values.
`plot_GMM_clusters` is a function for plotting a t-SNE plot, coloured by cluster membership. This function makes use of the `Rtsne` and `ggplot2` package for running the t-SNE algorithm and for plotting.
`calculate_dist` is a function for computing the distance between two covariance matrices. The function makes use of the `expm` package for matrix operations such as logarithm and square root.
`intercluster_dist` is a function to compute a distance matrix for clusters from GMM, and to plot a heatmap of this distance matrix. This function also uses the package `pheatmap` for generating heatmaps.
AI tools were used during debugging for the functions.
